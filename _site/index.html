      <section id="main_content">
        <p>Welcome! This is a beginner-friendly page devoted to walking you through making your very own Pull Request. We assume you have some clue what a Pull Request is or what it’s used for, or else you wouldn’t have found this page. Still, let’s review a bit.</p>

<p>Pull Requests are a way to submit changes to (code) repositories. Repositories are collectons of files hosted on sites like <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>, most often associated with software development. Software developers use repositories and Pull Requests to track changes to code bases over time.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, we’ll walk through creating a Pull Request against the followng code repository: <a href="https://makeapullrequest.github.io/">https://makeapullrequest.github.io/</a></p>

<p>By the time you’re finished, you’ll have submitted a real change to a real codebase and be able to see your username listed among others getting started.</p>

<p>The use case we’re walking through is submitting code to an exisiting repository - this is exactly what you might do to contribute to an <a href="https://github.com/open-source">Open Source</a> project.</p>

<p>So, let’s get to it!</p>

<h1 id="step-0-make-a-github-account">Step 0: Make a GitHub account</h1>

<p>We’re going to be contributing to a codebase hosted on GitHub. In order to do so, you’ll need a GitHub account. If you have one, login - if you do not, you’ll need to <a href="https://github.com/join">sign up</a>.</p>

<h1 id="step-1-fork-the-repository">Step 1: Fork the repository</h1>

<p>The first step in your journey to making a Pull Request against an existing repository is to create a copy of that repository. The purpose of doing so is that we can work on that copy without any fear of messing up the original.</p>

<p>AThere are many ways to copy a repository - the method we’ll use is called [<em>forking</em>]</p>

<p>To fork a repository, head to its webpage and select the <strong>Fork</strong> button.</p>

<p>For this tutorial, we’ll be forking the following repository: <a href="https://github.com/MakeAPullRequest/makeapullrequest.github.io">https://github.com/MakeAPullRequest/makeapullrequest.github.io</a></p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/tutorial/Fork.gif" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/tutorial/Fork.gif" alt="Fork the repository" /></a></p>

<p>(Note: <em>If you are a part of any Organizations</em>, you will be prompted to pick where to Fork the repository to - either an Organization or your own personal account. For this tutorial, select your own account)</p>

<h1 id="step-2-make-changes-to-the-forked-repository">Step 2: Make changes to the forked repository</h1>

<p>Next, we’ll make changes to the repository we forked. There are many ways to modify the content of a repository. For this tutorial, we’ll be using the GitHub web interface to make our changes.</p>

<p>We will be updating a file called <strong>contributors.yml</strong> and adding our own GitHub username to it.</p>

<p>To begin - locate the file you’d like to modify. For this tutorial, the file we want to modify is found at <strong>_data/contributors.yml</strong></p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/tutorial/LocateFile.gif" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/tutorial/LocateFile.gif" alt="Locate the file to modify" /></a></p>

<p>Locate the <strong>Edit</strong> icon (a pencil) and select it. You’ll now be able to modify that file directly via the webpage.</p>

<p>Again, don’t worry about making mistakes! We’re in our own copy (a.k.a. fork) of the repository, so it doesn’t matter if we mess up.</p>

<p>Add your username to the list of contributors - to do so, add text similar to the following to the end of the file:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>- username: @YOUR-USERNAME-HERE
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a href="/assets/images/tutorial/ModifyFile.gif" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/tutorial/ModifyFile.gif" alt="Modify the file" /></a></p>

<h1 id="step-3-commit-the-changes-to-the-forked-repository">Step 3: Commit the changes to the forked repository</h1>

<p>After your modifications are complete, you need to save them. Scroll down to the area entitled <strong>Commit changes</strong></p>

<p>There, add a short message describing your changes (e.g. “Added username”) and select <strong>Commit changes</strong></p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/tutorial/CommitChanges.gif" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/tutorial/CommitChanges.gif" alt="Commit changes" /></a></p>

<h1 id="step-4-create-the-pull-request">Step 4: Create the Pull Request!</h1>

<p>It’s finally time to create our Pull Request - this will notifiy the owners of the original repository that we have changes for them to review.</p>

<p>Select the <strong>Pull requests</strong> tab, then <strong>New pull request</strong></p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/tutorial/StartPullRequest.gif" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/tutorial/StartPullRequest.gif" alt="Start a Pull Request" /></a></p>

<p>GitHub will automatically understand that you want to introduce the changes in your <em>forked</em> repository into the <em>original</em> repository. You may see the word <strong>base</strong> and <strong>head</strong>, but they don’t matter much in terms of this tutorial. Each term simply represents the original and forked repository respectively.</p>

<p>On the <strong>Comparing changes</strong> page, you can see exactly what the suggested differences are (this set of changes is called a “diff”).</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/tutorial/Diff.png" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/tutorial/Diff.png" alt="Diff" /></a></p>

<p>To finish off creating the Pull Request, select <strong>Create pull request</strong> then fill out the form entitled <strong>Open a pull request</strong>. You’ll need to add a title - and optionally a description – to explain the changes you’re making.</p>

<p>Lastly, select <strong>Create pull request</strong></p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/tutorial/CreatePullRequest.gif" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/tutorial/CreatePullRequest.gif" alt="Create a Pull Request" /></a></p>

<h1 id="step-5-await-your-pull-request-being-merged">Step 5: Await your Pull Request being merged</h1>

<p>You did it! You submitted a request to change a code repository. Your Pull Request should look something like this:</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/tutorial/PullRequestOpen.png" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/tutorial/PullRequestOpen.png" alt="Open Pull Request" /></a></p>

<p>What happens next is in control of the maintainers of the original repository. They now have the ability to see exactly what changes you’d like to make to their repository - and, if they’re satisfied, they will <em>merge</em> your work into the original repository. Merging your work means it becomes a part of the original repository. Here’s what a merged Pull Request looks like:</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/tutorial/PullRequestMerged.png" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/tutorial/PullRequestMerged.png" alt="Merged Pull Requet" /></a></p>

<p>If you’ve been following this tutorial, once your Pull Request is merged you’ll see your name appear on this webpage: <a href="/contributors">/contributors</a></p>

<p>Congrats! You’ve joined a worldwide community of developers contributing to code online.</p>
