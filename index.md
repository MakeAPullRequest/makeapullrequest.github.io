Let's get started making our first Pull Request.

# Step 0: Make a GitHub account

# Step 1: Fork the repository

The first step in your journey to making a Pull Request against an existing repository is to create a copy of that repository. There are many ways to copy a repository, the method we'll use is called *forking*. [Read More](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo)

To fork a repository, head to its webpage and select the **Fork** button.

If you are a part of any Organizations, you will be prompted to pick where to Fork the repository to - either an Organization or your own personal account. For this tutorial, select your own account.

# Step 2: Make changes to the forked repository

Next, we'll make changes to the repository we forked. Again, there are many ways to modify the content of a repository. For this tutorial, we'll be using the GitHub web interface to make our changes.

We will be updating a file called **contributors.yml** and adding our own GitHub username to it.

To begin - locate the file you'd like to modify.

Locate the Edit icon (a pencil) and select it. You'll now be able to modify that file directly. And, don't worry about making mistakes - were in our own copy (a.k.a. fork) of the repository, so it doesn't matter if we mess up!
