Let's get started making our first Pull Request.

# Step 0: Make a GitHub account

# Step 1: Fork the repository

To start forking a repository, head to its webpage and select the **Fork** button.

If you are a part of any Organizations, you will be prompted to pick where to Fork the repository to - either an Organization or your own personal account. For this tutorial, select your own account.
